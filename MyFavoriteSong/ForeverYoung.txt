Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine when the space is one?
As we turn our faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are the melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't wanna perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures, couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams waiting out in the blue
We'll let them come true
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young
I want to live forever young
